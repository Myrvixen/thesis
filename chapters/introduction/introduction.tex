\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

In this thesis we explore the following research question and hypotheses 

\begin{enumerate}[start=0, label={(\bfseries R\arabic*):}]
\item To what degree are we able to separate event classes from an AT-TPC experiment using non-sequential and sequential neural network models 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent with the related hypotheses 

\begin{enumerate}[start=0, label={(\bfseries H\arabic*):}]
\item[] There exists a mapping from raw AT-TPC data to some lower dimensional vector space $\mathbf{z}$ such that: 
\item a hyperplane in this space separates the event types present
\item the mapping clusters the event types present in disjoint sets under some distance metric
\end{enumerate}

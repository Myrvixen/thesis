\chapter{Theory}

The hypothesis explored in this thesis is that we can extract compressed information about physical events from the AT-TPC experiment using modern machine learning methods. With the underlying research question asking what information are we able to capture about nuclear events in the AT-TPC without needing hand-labeling of data. To achieve this we employ the DRAW algorithm (\cite{Gregor2015}). The DRAW algorithm is built of neural network components in a joint architecture comprised of a Variational Autoencoder wrapped in a Long Term Short Term Memory cell. Each  of the components are discussed in their own sections starting with the neural network in  section \ref{sec:ANN} then followed by autoencoders in section \ref{sec:autoencoder} and finally recurrent neural networks in \ref{sec:rnn}. 

\noindent Furthermore we hypothesize that this compressed information can be used to linearly separate events in classes. We assert this by employing Logistic Regression as described in section \ref{sec:LogReg}. The linear separation of data serves as a precursor to using clustering algorithms to entirely remove the need of researcher intervention in labeling AT-TPC data. In the experiment at hand we hope to separate proton and carbon elastic scattering in a magnetic field. The strength of this model is that it does not rely on hand-labeled data. We demonstrate this first by applying the DRAW algorithm to simulated data showing that we can construct very good separations before turning to real data.

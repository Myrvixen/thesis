\chapter{Theory}

The hypothesis for this thesis is that we can extract compressed information about physical events from the AT-TPC experiment using modern machine learning methods. To achieve this we employ the DRAW algorithm (\cite{Gregor2015}). The DRAW algorithm is compromised of a Variational Autoencoder wrapped in a Long Term Short Term Memory cell each discussed in their own sections \ref{sec:autoencoder} and \ref{sec:rnn} respectively. Furthermore we hypothesize that this compressed information can be used to linearly separate events in classes. The strength of this model is that it does not rely on hand-labeled data. We demonstrate this first by applying the DRAW algorithm to simulated data showing that we can construct very good separations before turning to real data.

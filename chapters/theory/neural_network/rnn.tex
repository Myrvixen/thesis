\section{Recurrent Neural Networks}\label{sec:rnn}

\subsection{Introduction to recurrent neural networks}

The recurrent neural network (RNN) models a unit that has "memory". The memory is encoded as a state variable which is ordinarily concatenated with the input when the network predicts. The model predictions enact a sequence which has led to applications in the generation of text, time series predictions and other serialized applications. RNNs were first discussed in a theoretical paper by Jordan, MI in 86' but implemented in the modern temporal sense by \citet{Pearlmutter1989}.

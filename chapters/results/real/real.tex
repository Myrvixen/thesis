\section{Real AT-TPC events}
The events analyzed in this section were retrieved from the on-going AT-TPC experiment at Michigan State University. In the experiment a beam of a particular isotope is accelerated and directed into a chamber with a gas that acts as the reaction medium and target. As reactions occur between the gas and beam ejected electrons from these drift towards the anode and the Micromegas measuring the impact over time from the reactions. The measuring apparatus is very sensitive, and though filtering is performed such that only the peaks of deposited charge the events are noisy in the $Ar_{46}$ experiment subject to analysis in this thesis. There is both structural noise that can be attributed to electronics cross-talk and possible interactions with cosmic background radiation and other sources of charged particles. Indeed one of the confounding factors is that there is currently not an understanding of the physics of the major contributing factors to this noise.

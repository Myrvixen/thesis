\section{Experimental setup and design}

The experiments were conducted using the AI-Hub computational resource at the university of Oslo.  This resource consists of three machines with four RTX $2080$ Nvidia graphics cards each. These cards have about $10$GB of memory available to allocate model weights. All experiments described in this section were all computed using this hardware.

\chapter{Classification results}

The training procedure for classification using a semi-supervised regime as the one we'll apply necessitates the same strict separation of labeled data for the classification step as when considering ordinary classification tasks. Details on the modeling pipeline can be found in section \ref{sec:models}. All models excepting the baseline VGG model were tuned with the \lstinline{RandomSearch} architecture which searches in a semi structured way over all the parameters given in table \ref{tab:convae_hyperparams}. The top $40$ runs from each model is listed in appendix \ref{tab:convae_randomsearch}\todo{correct appendix link and add performance tables?} with their corresponding proton $f1$ score. We optimize the classification performance for each dataset listed in section \ref{sec:data}. Additionally plots of $f1$ performance as a function of the number of labeled samples is included. As a benchmark we start by measuring the performance using just the pre-trained VGG16 representation of the labeled data of each dataset. The two proposed representation algorithms are then presented with results for each dataset for comparison.

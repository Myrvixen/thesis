\section{Hyperparameter search architecture}\label{sec:hyperparam_search_arch}

To tune the hyperparameters of the sequential and non sequential autoencoders we implement an object oriented searching framework. A parent class \lstinline{ModelGenerator} defines the logging variables and the type of model to be generated, i.e. one of \lstinline{ConVAE} or \lstinline{DRAW}. As well as helper functions to log performance metrics and loss values. The \lstinline{ModelGenerator} class is treated as an abstract class in that it should never be instantiated on it's own, only through its children. One subclass is implemented for the \lstinline{ConVAE} and \lstinline{DRAW} model classes. They share common functionality and maintain a grid over all the search able hyperparameters which we sample from to perform the search. Searching, saving to file and other utilities are maintained in the \lstinline{RandomSearch} class which is instantiated with one of the \lstinline{ModelGenerator} subclasses and implements a \lstinline{.search} method which performs and logs the search to a specified directory.

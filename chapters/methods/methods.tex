\section{Introduction}

In this  chapter we will illustrate the research pipeline applied to the experimental data from the AT-TPC. We will show the implementation of the algorithms described in section \ref{ch:ml}, and their performance on simulated data to illustrate their workings and to establish a baseline for the inquiry into the real experimental data.

The implementation of the algorithms described in chapter \ref{ch:ml} have been implemented for this thesis in the python programming language (\cite{python}). Parts of algorithms displayed for demonstration or exposition have been developed in the numerical python framework numpy (\cite{numpy}). While variational autoencoder and DRAW algorithms were implemented in the tensorflow framework (\cite{tensorflow}). The choice of python as the framework in which to develop this thesis was made for the ease of rapid prototyping and the extensive availability of mature numerical libraries like the ones cited above. Plots of numerical performance and data visualization was achieved with the matplotlib graphics package for python (\cite{matplotlib}).

We begin by describing the tensorflow framework as it with that api that the algorithms are implemented.
